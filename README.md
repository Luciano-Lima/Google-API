# WeGetYouThere

A simple and effective travel agency website project designed to give the users a clear view of the most popular holiday destinations and the most visited cities in the world.

The project is divided in 3 sections, one of the section includes an interactive google maps in which the users have the ability to perform search for places, and also be able to find nearby attractions.


## UX

This website was designed specially for people who love to spend some time traveling around the world. Contradicting to the majority of the travel agency websites out there which have way too many pictures flying around which could overwhelm and distract
the user who doesn't have a clear destination in mind yet where to go, the WeGetYouThere website only shows to the travellers lovers the most popular and affordable places to visit.

    •  The users can search any destination, tourist attractions, bar, restaurants or anything they want using the search bar at the top of the page.

    •  The users can immediately find in the first section the most popular holiday destination to travel to and make a booking enquire.

    •  The users can also in the second section find the most visited cities.

    •  The users can sign up to receive special deals on holiday destinations straight to their inbox.

    •  The users have the ability to click in the map markers to find where the popular holiday destinations are and get the respective place geographical information.

    •  The users can also use the search bar in the map to search for a destination, select one of the option bellow the map and click back anywhere in the map to find nearby places like, hotel, bar, restaurants, museum and stores.

    •  The users can click and drag the yellow icon in the map to see the street view for the place they have previously selected.

    •  The users can zoom in and out to get a better view in the map.

    • The users can contact us just by clicking in the envelop in the Get in Touch section.

    • The users can follow us in the major social medias just by clicking in the links icons located at the bottom of the third section near to the footer.

## Testing

This project was manually tested in all the major browsers including Google Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer to confirm compatibility. The tests were conducted in virtual mode using the google developer tools and also physical mobile phones such us: Nokia, Samsung Galaxy, HtcM8, Samsung Tablet S4, IPad and IPhone5. I can confirm the project has a mobile friendly design and it does work in all platforms.

I have used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> to validate the HTML code and corrected all the major error or warning messages. I have also uploaded the CSS file to <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validator</a> to check for error and the result was clear, no error or warning was detected.

The links in the navigation were tested individually to make sure it does have a smoothly scrolling functionality and does direct to the relevant content in the page.

The buttons for booking, signUp and contact were tested individually to make sure it does get to the relevant forms. Each one of the forms, in which includes the booking form, signUp form and the contact form were tested individually to make sure the fields are required and so the forms can not be sent if a field is left empty, if it does a message will display asking the user to fill it. Each one of the forms were tested filled out all fields to make sure on submission a feedback message is displayed.

The social media links were tested individually to make sure it does redirect the user to the relevant content. The search bar at the top of the page was tested performing searches for places and cities and I can confirm it does return the relevant content on the next page.

The google maps at the bottom of the page was tested performing searches such as cities and it does show the relevant content in the map. The markers in the map were individually tested to make sure the zoom functionality works properly, is centered in the map and does display the correct information.

The buttons for hotel, bar, restaurant, museum and store was tested individually to make sure it does work as expect and does display the relevant nearby places in the map.

A search test on the map for a city that does not have a museum nearby was performed to confirm that when no resuts are available it does display a message telling the user that no nearby place was found.

All the functionality for street view, zooming in and out where tested individually to make sure every single button does perform the result as expected.
